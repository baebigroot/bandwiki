            <p>
                Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. They were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums.
